					<h3>History</h3>
					<p>At the turn of the 20th century the New York Café (New York Kávéház) was the most beautiful and the most beloved coffee house in Budapest. It was a popular place among writers and editors, in fact, the most influential newspapers were edited here, upstairs in the gallery.</p>

					<h3>Poem by K.Dezső</h3>
					<p>" New York, you coffee house, where I spent so many days</p>
					<p>  Let me open your door, and maybe take a seat,</p>
					<p>  Just like a pauper, lying in the street,</p>
					<p>  To see what remains of me and of this place."</p>
